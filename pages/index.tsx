				<Heading className="mb-6">Zeroth Hour: Breaking the Silence</Heading>
				<Details>
					Many, if not all of us, are aware of the social ills that plague our
					society. These issues are detrimental to the overall quality of life
					of many people around the world. There's much we can do to work
					towards solving these ills, but the international community (and us,
					as individuals) tend to find ways to delay progress.
				</Details>
				<Details>
					For example, the pandemic is often used as a scapegoat by many
					governments for not appropriately meeting the 2030 SDG Agenda even
					though they were already not enacting sufficient changes before the
					pandemic.
				</Details>
				<Details>
					As a double entendre, it refers to the literal zeroth hour- we have
					many issues to solve in a limited timeframe and to the military
					‚Äúzero-hour‚Äù term, which refers to the time a planned exercise is about
					to begin. It is a metaphor for all the concerns that have been put on
					wait and are gradually creating irreparable harm.
				</Details>
				<Details>
					As humans, we are in a predicament where we have a very limited amount
					of time until such difficulties outweigh our ability to address them.
					Therefore, we must take the initiative to break this silence as we
					approach the zeroth hour.
