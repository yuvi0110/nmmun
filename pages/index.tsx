						Zeroth Hour: Breaking the Silence
					</Heading>
					<Details opacity={0.9}>
						Many of us are acutely aware of the social challenges that afflict
						our society, significantly impacting the quality of life for people
						worldwide.{" "}
						<span className="md:hidden">
							<br />
							<br />
						</span>{" "}
						These issues demand our attention, and while there's much we can do
						to address them, both as a global community and as individuals,
						progress often seems to be postponed.
					</Details>
					<Details opacity={0.9}>
						For instance, the pandemic has frequently been used as a convenient
						excuse by numerous governments to justify their failure to
						effectively pursue the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
						even though inadequacies in addressing these issues existed long
						before the pandemic emerged.
					</Details>
					<Details opacity={0.9}>
						This situation is symbolically referred to as "Zeroth Hour,"
						carrying a dual meaning. It signifies the pressing nature of the
						problems we face, emphasizing the limited time available to find
						solutions.{" "}
						<span className="md:hidden">
							<br />
							<br />
						</span>{" "}
						Additionally, it alludes to the military term "zero-hour," denoting
						the moment when a planned operation commences.{" "}
						<span className="md:hidden">
							<br />
							<br />
						</span>{" "}
						This metaphor underscores that delaying action on these critical
						concerns only compounds the irreversible damage they cause.{" "}
						<span className="md:hidden">
							<br />
							<br />
						</span>{" "}
						We, as humans, find ourselves in a precarious position where time is
						running out, and it's imperative that we break this cycle of
						inaction as we approach our own "zeroth hour."
